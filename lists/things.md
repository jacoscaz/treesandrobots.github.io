Taking care of our material belongings is not a trivial affair. In fact, for
many people 

There's very few things I detest more than looking for a tool and either not
finding it or, worse, finding a sub-par tool that slows me down or ruins my
work.

Even worse, I can't stand the idea of investing time and money and things that
do not deserve such investment, 

  like to surround myself with _good_ tools. Not necessarily _the best_, but
_good_. Not necessarily the _most aesthetically pleasing_, but _nice looking_.

## Shaving

I find the simplicity and elegance of a double-edge safety razor very hard to
beat. Plus, it's friendlier to the environment and to the wallet than any other
shaving solution I've ever tried and it's one less device that needs charging.
