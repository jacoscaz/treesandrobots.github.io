What follows is a list of software dependencies that I particularly appreciate
and that I keep coming back to for most of my projects.

Mostly, these software components reflect the principles I've delineated in my
post [Principles and guidelines for (good) software development][intro0], with
particular stress on performance and as few indirect dependencies as possible.
