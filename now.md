This is my [now page][n1], a page in which I briefly summarize what I'm focused
on and where I am at this point in my life. More about me in the [about][n3]
page. Last updated on <time datetime="2024-08-28">2024-08-28</time>.

My current professional focus is software platforms that aggregate
[distributed energy resources][DER] into grid-scale actors capable
of participating in [energy markets] and [flexibility markets].

<details markdown="1">
<summary>More specifically</summary>
I focus on [Virtual Power Plant]
(VPP) platforms that aggregate fleets of [EV charging station]s, leveraging
advanced features such as _smart charging_ and [Vehicle-to-Grid] (V2G)
capabilities to better meet the energy and flexibility demands generated by
market players such [TSO]s, [DSO]s and [electricity producer]s. I mostly work
behind the scenes, ranging from [OCPP] gateways to fleet-wide control loops.

Outside of work and on top of the foundational time spent with my family, our
friends and our dog, I'm mainly focusing on fitness, healthy habits and home
automation.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>More specifically</summary>
I'm currently working on:

- Exploring local-first architectures for [home automation] through the
  [Homie MQTT convention].
- Crafting a wireless charging station that encourages spending more time
  away from our mobile devices.
- Developing a daily, sustainable, low-equipment [strength training] routine
  and incorporating more movement into my life ([sport climbing], [bouldering]
  and perhaps tennis). Interested? [Check it out!][routine].
</details>

Looking ahead I'd like to learn the basics of investing, approaching it through
the lens of long-term financial security and independence.
