This is my [now page][n1], a page in which I briefly summarize
what I'm focused on and where I am at this point in my life. More
about now pages on [Derek Sivers's blog][n2]. This page was last

My current professional focus is software platforms that aggregate smaller
energy resources into grid-scale actors capable of participating in
[energy markets] and [flexibility markets].

More specifically, I focus on [Virtual Power Plant] (VPP) platforms that
aggregate [charging stations] for electric vehicles, leveraging
_smart charging_ and [Vehicle-to-Grid] (V2G) capabilities. I mostly work
behind the scenes, ranging from [OCPP] gateways to real-time control loops.

Outside of work I'm exploring local-first architectures for [home automation]
through the [Homie MQTT convention] and developing a balanced, sustainable,
low-equipment [strength training] program.
