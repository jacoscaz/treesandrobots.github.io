Music: "Spirits" by [Nothing More][1]. Evocative mix of post-screamo,
hardcore and nu metal with accents of djent and EDM. This is what happens
when teenage angst grows up and focuses on overcoming the struggles of adult
life. **Loved** it. Highlights: "Ships in the Night", "Don't Look Back", 
"Deja Vu", "Dream With Me".
