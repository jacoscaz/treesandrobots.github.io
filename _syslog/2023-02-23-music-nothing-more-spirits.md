Music: "Spirits" by [Nothing More][1]. Evocative mix of post-screamo,
hardcore and nu metal with accents of djent and EDM. This is what happens
when we embrace our teenage angst as we grow up, learning how to wield it
and focus it against the struggles of adult life. **Loved** it. Highlights: 
"Ships in the Night", "Don't Look Back",  "Deja Vu",  "Dream With Me".
