title: Sea of Tranquility by Emility St. John Mandel
description: Book review
---

[Sea of Tranquility][1] by [Emily St. John Mandel][2] is a glorious celebration
of longing and belonging, of beauty, of empathy. A graceful, intimate work of 
speculative fiction masterfully woven across time, confronting some of mankind's
fundamental questions with a sense of wonder that never dissipates. I'll have to 
read it again soon.
