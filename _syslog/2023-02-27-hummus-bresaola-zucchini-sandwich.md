title: Hummus, zucchini and bresaola sandwhich
description: Recipe for a nice, nutritious sandwhich
---

Slice the zucchini lengthwise into strips and quickly sear them on high-heat.
Don't be shy with the hummus, don't make the zucchini strips too thin or too 
dry. Add 2 - 3 slices of [bresaola][1]. Optionally, olive oil. Best made with 
sourdough bread. Delicious!
