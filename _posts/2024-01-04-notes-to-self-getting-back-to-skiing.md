description: Notes to help me get back into proper skiing technique
---

I've just made it back from the slopes, having gone to ski in the alps for the
first time in roughly ten years, and I have some notes that I would really, 
_really_ like my future self to revisit the next time I decide to go skiing:

1. Whether renting or buying, you have a tendency to get ski boots that are
   too large. If you can even think of walking more than a few meters without
   unfastening the latches, the boots are not ok. Do not think you can offset
   too large a pair of boots with thicker or multiple pairs of socks:
   _it never works_.
2. You have a tendency to start out by being too conservative in how you shift
   your balance from one side to the other while turning. This makes you put
   too much pressure on the downhill leg,  even in the transtion phase between
   turns, which guarantees that you'll have to end the first day prematurely 
   because you'll have overworked your legs. As your skiing trips generally
   last a couple of days, this is definitely a bad strategy.
3. Starting out, allocate a little time to reacquainting yourself with the
   feeling of exiting turns with your center of gravity ever so slightly
   uphill with respect to your skis, which should be parallel and close
   together. This will allow you to distribute your weight and momentum on both
   legs while transitioning between turns.
4. Starting out, exaggerate the _hopping_ motion as you turn, saying out loud
   the word _[oplà][1]_ with every change of direction. Remember, skiing is fun.
5. When doing full turns, you seldom bail out from completely closing the turn
   and find yourself fighting against your skis going from a nice parallel
   stance to an awkward semi-snowplow stance. Commit to the turn by _punching
   your way through it_ with your downhill hand.
6. You worry too much about forward / backward weight placement. Let your body
   find the right balance given the conditions on the slope.
7. When in doubt, contemplate how elegantly and effortlessly your wife goes
   down even the harshest of slopes. Then get annoyed at her, then be thankful
   for her, then try to reproduce that.
