What follows is one of the simplest, most overlooked, most wonderful pasta
recipes. It's a summer recipe, ideal for those 4pm lunches
after a day spent at the beach, and a staple of my family's cuisine.

## Ingredients

- 400gr fresh pasta
- 350gr cherry tomatoes, roma tomatoes or italian plum tomatoes
- olive oil
- fresh basil
- salt

Serves two, although the quantities and process can be easily tweaked to serve
many more.

Always use the best ingredients you can get. When buying at a grocery store,
ingredients grown/farmed locally and to organic standards tend to be the better
options. Oil, in particular, plays a critical role in this recipe. Use a 
_good_, extra-virgin, mild to medium-strength olive oil.

## The recipe

Quarter the tomatoes on a chopping board. Use a high-quality wooden board. If
you do not have such a board, you should re-evaluate your life priorities and 
immediately acquire one.

Get a bunch of fresh basil leaves. Wash the leaves, pat them dry with paper
towels and remove the leaves from the stem. _Tear_ the leaves into smaller
chunks.

Put the basil and the tomatoes in a bowl, add salt, olive oil and gently mix 
until no salt crystals are left visible. Then, mix a little more until a gentle
aroma of basil reaches your nose. Take a break. Breathe in. This is one of the 
little joys in life.

Prepare the water for the pasta. Use a medium-sized pot, filled with enough
water to completely cover the pasta while still having plenty of room 
available. While you wait for the water to reach its boiling temperature, 
consider giving in to the natural temptation of making yourself a small 
[frisella][frisella]. 350gr of tomatoes are clearly too much for two, after 
all.

As the water starts boiling, add a conservative handful of salt. Wait for a 
minute, taste the water and adjust with a little more salt if needed. Add the
pasta and let it cook to the only resonable consistency for proper pasta: 
[al dente][al-dente]. Do not get distracted. Do not read emails. Do not look at 
your phone. This is a good time to contemplate the marvel of nature as 
perfectly embodied by your wooden chopping board.

I warmly suggest using a type of fresh pasta called [pici][pici], often 
described as fat spaghetti. Alternatively, [orecchiette][orecchiette] are an
excellent option. Generally speaking, use a type of pasta whose dough is made
with flour and water alone. No eggs, no additional ingredients.

Drain the pasta, saving a couple spoonfuls of water for later. Leave the pasta 
to cool down for a minute or two, so that it will not cook the oil on contact. 
After all this effort, such an outcome would be worthy of the saddest tragedy.

Pour the pasta into the bowl and stir everything together until the pasta is 
completely coated by a shiny layer of tomato-y deliciousness and well-mixed 
with the quartered tomato and basil leaves. A few splashes of cooking water
will help in case of an exceedinly dry mix.

## Variations

For a more complete dish with a greater variety of textures, try adding 150gr
of baby mozzarellas to the mix of basil and tomato. 

Other additions to the mix include garlic, for a stronger kick, and herbs such
as thyme and oregano for a more complete taste of mediterranean flavours. Make 
sure to remove all leftover garlic cloves before serving.
