title: Dogs, fur and vacuum cleaners

_TL;DR - Furry companion? Invest in a nice stick vacuum cleaner that is
easy to clean and maintain, comes with an articulated and motorized cleaner
head and lasts enough to cover one floor. The Dyson V10 is a good option._

Our dog, a [Maremma Sheepdog][0] mix, sheds an unbelievable amount of fur.
As with almost all natural recurring phenomena there's a pattern to her
shedding, with peaks and valleys correlating to her activity levels, her
health, the time of the year and the varying consistency of our brushing
sessions. Still, even at her lowest level of shedding it only takes a day or
two for fur to visibly and unhygienically deposit in corners and underneath
all kinds of forniture, in addition to aggregating into ever moving rolls not
unlike [Tumbleweed][1].

Vacuuming consistency is *the* only long-term solution, here, and the tool that
best enables vacuuming consistency is a nice [stick vacuum cleaner][2]. We've
had a few so far, most notably a [Rowenta Air Force 360][4] and our current
[Dyson V10][3]. Picking one is never easy and I've enjoyed perusing through
reviews and selection criteria shared by others; it's only fair for us to share
ours:

1. **Capacity**: a stick vacuum cleaner should have a canister ample enough to
   last an entire floor, assuming consistent, daily usage. The battery should
   also last as much as the daily vacuuming session. Both the Rowenta and the
   Dyson last well beyond 30 minutes at their lowest (but still sufficient)
   power setting, which is plenty enough for me to go through one floor.
2. **Ease of maintenance**: a stick vacuum cleaner should be easy to empty,
   clean and maintain. I've found emptying and cleaning the Rowenta to be an
   exercise in frustration, to the point that it drove us to look for an
   alternative. The Dyson has, so far, proven to be _excellent_ in this regard.
   Everything is painless and straightforward, from daily emptying to complete
   teardown.
3. **Durability**: a stick vacuum cleaner should not feel like a toy and should
   be capable of withstanding minor stresses to its frame. I've never had any
   structural issue with either the Rowenta or the Dyson, although the former
   did feel significantly sturdier than the latter. They don't quite feel
   as sturdy as some of the top-tier brands (Miele, Sabo, ...) but they're fine
   for their price range.
4. **Articulated, motorized cleaner heads:** a stick vacuum cleaner should
   have an articulated, motorized, rotating cleaner head capable of fitting
   in tight spaces. Rotating brushes are complementary to suction as they are
   dramatically more effective at dislodging dirt, dust and fur so that they
   may be picked up into the air flow. Both the Rowenta and the Dyson come with
   articulated cleaner heads: the  articulation of the Rowenta's head makes it
   better suited for tighter clearances whereas the brush in the Dyson's head 
   seems to be better at releasing fur into the cleaner without it getting
   stuck within the brush itself.

For our latest pick I would have opted for something recommended by
[r/VacuumCleaners][5] but ultimately settled on the Dyson due to a combination
of good reviews by friends and family and to the fact that we can have it
serviced close to home should we ever need to do so.
