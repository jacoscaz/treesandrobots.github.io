title: "2020 yearly theme: System Consolidation"
description: Celebrating 2020, Cortex-style

In the website of [The Theme System Journal][5], the amazing hosts of the
[Cortex][1] podcast [Myke Hurley][2] and [CGP Grey][3] present the concept of
yearly theme:

> Instead of resolutions, we set an overall idea of how we would like to
> approach each year or season. This becomes almost like a guiding principle
> for our work and/or personal lives for that period. [...] When creating a 
> Yearly Theme it’s a good idea to think about what your ideal outcome is for
> that period, and think of some key actions you would like to complete. Then
> as you go through the year, it’s important to remember this theme when 
> considering new projects — this ensures that you are sticking to what you 
> want to achieve.

In this blog post I will go through what my theme for this year is and why I
have settled on such theme. I've decided to write about this because I deeply
feel that it is _important_, that important things are worth thinking about
in a serious manner and that writing is the best way to do so.

Writing it out makes my yearly theme _real_. It puts it _out there_, clearly 
stated, where everyone can see it and everyone can ask about it. Furthermore, 
I hope it will inspire others to think about their own themes, just as I was
inspired by those of Myke and Grey.

My yearly theme for 2020 is **System Consolidation**. It is comprised of two 
carefully selected words, the first of which represents how I intend to look
at myself and the second of which indicates what I intend to do with myself.

In thinking of myself as a system, I aim to remind myself that I am a complex
machine and that, just as any other machine, I have limits beyond which I am 
unable to operate without compromising my integrity and requiring unscheduled
maintenance. I am not only a system but an open system, operating within an
environment with which I exchange energy. This exchange of energy must be in 
balance, in that energy cannot be made out of nothing and I cannot use more of 
it than I consume. If I do, then I consume myself in order to do so.

In aiming to consolidate myself, I recognize the fact that I have spread myself
across too many fronts and that I need to let go of some of me so that what
remains will be able to grow and flourish. Which is not to say I wouldn't do it
all over again! On the contrary, I am happy with how my life has unfolded over
the last few years and I count myself lucky that I can say so. However, the last
few years have often been about operating in overdrive, indebting my past self
to my current self in order to sustain a time of growth and exploration. I now
owe it to myself to consolidate my working life, my health, my relationships, my
responsibilities into something that can be serenely sustained over time.

I am a software developer and a founder and director of a small, growing
company. I am someone who works out. In no particular order I am also a partner,
a friend, the owner of a dog, someone dear to his family and a 31 year-old man.

This is who I am, and who I'll be throughout 2020. This is what I will get
better at, what I will focus on. With whatever time will be left, if any, I
might do some occasional reading and DYI work.
