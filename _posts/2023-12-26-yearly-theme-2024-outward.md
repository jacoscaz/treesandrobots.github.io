Happy 2024! 

In this post I review the past couple of years through the lens of 
[my 2022 yearly theme][0], having skipped picking a theme for 2023, and discuss
the new theme for 2024. If you're new to the concept of yearly themes I suggest
listening to episodes [#95][4] and [#110][3] of the Cortex podcast to find out 
more.

## Retrospective on 2022 - 2023's _Intentional Heartbeats_

My theme for 2022 was "Intentional Heartbeats", a theme through which I wanted
to orient myself towards a better work/life balance, allocating more time and 
resources to my non-working life and particularly to fitness and hobbies.

Granted, I had two years to work on it, but when I look back at the last couple
of years I feel I can unreservedly say that, for the first time since I've started
thinking about yearly themes, I've done a great job.

Fitness has once again become my main hobby, as it used to be years ago. 
My physical condition has progressed well beyond the abysmal state in which it 
had been languishing for the last few years, having made tangible progress
across most basic moves in the calisthenics and weightlifting domains. I have
resumed working on my very own workout program, a hybrid of calisthenics and
weightlifting optimized for daily commitment. What matters the most, however,
is the consistency that I've managed to develop, making fitness once again
simply another aspect of my life.

More recently and on top of my fitness work, I've also gone back to plucking
the strings of my electric bass and pulling off what could be considered, at
times, a passable imitation of an actual bass player. I really am nothing of
the sorts, though.

All this would not have been possible without the stability that I've built in
previous years and I'm absolutely grateful to my past self for taking the risk
of narrowing his focus at the expense of what I am now able to enjoy.

## New theme for 2024: _the year of outward_

My 2024 theme is "the year of outward", a gentle nudge towards those aspects
of existence that look outward into the world that surrounds us rather than
inward towards one's own self.

My yearly themes, so far, have mostly focused on _inward_ growth. For those who
know me, this should not come as a surprise. I am, after all, a (relatively)
introverted person who greatly prefers being alone doing my own thing, whatever
that might be, rather than having to participate in the shallow mingling that
characterizes many large gatherings of people. Though I like to think I have a
decent sense of style, I also have never really cared for appearances, having
spent most of my life with barely enough clothing items to scrounge a passable
look when required.

As most of us have come to realize in one way or another, however,
overindulging into one's own proclivities is a good recipe for disaster.
Furthermore, it's not as if I don't enjoy socialization _at all_. My ideal
social context entails few, selected people and a shared story that binds them
together; a context in which implicit communication and sharing a path play as
important a role to that of the spoken word. I am not interested in becoming a
hermit, which feels like a miserable way to live. I also have a deep
appreciation for understated style and elegance, though I have never got around
to experiment with those on myself.

These are just some of the aspects of life that I'd like to explore in 2024.

In practice, I think I'll start off by adding a social dimension to my fitness
and musical endeavours. I've long been wanting to join a local climbing gym,
for example. Also, investing some time in brushing up on music theory might put
me in a better place to start playing with others again. The latter might take
a while, though, as my musical brain has dramatically atrophied over the years
and I've been mostly living off of what little muscle memory is left in my 
fingers.

Professionally, I can't publicly say much about my plans for 2024 but, if all
goes well, I'll get to the end of the year with something of my own. A bit
nebulous, I know, but I'm very excited about it.

See you at the end of 2024!
