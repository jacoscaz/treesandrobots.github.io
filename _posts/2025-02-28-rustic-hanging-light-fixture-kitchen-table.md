title: "A rustic, hanging light fixture for the kitchen table"
description: ""
---

After 13 lunch breaks and a full weekend of work, I'm extremely pleased with
our new light fixture for the dining table.

We made it out of a rough-sawn board which we sanded, oiled, varnished and
equipped with fittings for [GU10 light bulbs][GU10] and a custom-made safety
railing to keep things placed on top of the board from falling off of it.
It required a little welding, a few 3D-printed parts, multiple coats of oil
and varnish and a heck of a lot of sanding.

My wife came up with the idea after seeing something similar online, though on
a much smaller scale, and I gladly took on the challenge to scale it up to our
requirements. Also, I had been yearning for a good excuse to learn the basics
of welding and I could hardly have found a better one.

I made the railing by [stick welding] lengths of square steel tube. The tube
I have used has a cross section of 1 cm x 1 cm and is 1 mm thick. I designed
and 3D-printed the stands for the railing at home using
[Prusament PETG Galaxy Black][petg], which goes _very_ well with the overall
rustic / industrial look.

I will happily admit to copious amounts of trial and error, having never done
any sort of welding prior to this project. I used metal plaster to smooth out
the inevitable imperfections before applying two coats of anti-rust, metallic
spray paint with an antique / matte finish.

I used warm, 2700K GU10 LED bulbs by Philips, each roughly equivalent to a 50 W
standard bulb. I can't recall their specific CRI index but, experientially, I'm
quite happy with the quality of the light that they emit. The board is 180 cm
in length and is fitted with six light bulbs, making it equivalent to roughly
300 W worth of standard bulbs. We find that amount of light to be _just right_
but, as they say, _your mileage may vary_. Actual power consumption sits at
around 28 W.

The light fixture hangs from the ceiling through four lengths of 1 mm steel wire 
rope, with turnbuckles used for the finer height and leveling adjustments.
Each of the 6 mm anchors used for the ceiling-mounted hooks is rated for loads
up to 15 kg while the wire is rated for loads up to 12 kgs; the latter is more
than twice the entire weight of the light fixture, giving us _a lot_ of safety
margin.
