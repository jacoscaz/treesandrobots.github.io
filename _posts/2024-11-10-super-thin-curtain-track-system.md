title: "Super-thin curtain track system"
description: ""
---

One of the quirks of our house is the extremely tiny clearances between the
boxes of our rolling shutters and our fixture frames. This quickly became a
minor annoyance as, no matter how many we tested, we could not find a curtain
track system whose track would fit within these tiny gaps and still allow our
doors and windows to swing unencumbered.

So&hellip; We decided to make our own!

The design is based around using a thin aluminum bar as the rail, trading
the much greater rigidity of rods and tracks for the bar's minimal clearance
requirements. C-shaped sliding elements "hug" the bar while staying clear of
the multiple button-head mounting screws equally spaced along the bar's length.

The specific bars I have used are 30 mm wide and 2 mm thick, which, for light
sheer curtains, required spacing mounting screws not more than 25 cm from one
another to keep the bar from bending.

Being fortunate enough to own a 3D printer I designed and printed the sliding
elements at home, over the span of a few days. All prints were done at the
lowest quality setting, with each layer being 0.3 mm thick, using PLA. Here's
the [.OBJ file][1], produced using [TinkerCad][2]. Feel free to use it in your
own projects!
