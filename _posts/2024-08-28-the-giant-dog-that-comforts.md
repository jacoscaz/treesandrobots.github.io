way that is as stunningly captivating as it is intensely worrying.

As is the case with many dogs, and rescues in particular, our dog is terrified
of rainstorms, thunders and lightning. Whilst not being a particularly physical
dog in the way she normally shows affection, during these events she frequently
seeks contact with my wife and/or myself, often spending entire the night on
our bed, curled up against us, shivering lightly.

So far, I have been lucky never to have had to confront fears so deep and
all-encompassing such as these, fears that would literally shake me to my
core for hours on end. Unfortunately, many others have and do every day.

In many ways, most dogs are unfiltered beings. Their emotional state is clearly
and immediately reflected in their behavior, unincumbered by the complex social
norms and expectations that characterize human relationships. There is no doubt
in my mind that witnessing a dog finding comfort in our presence is one of the 
purest and most profound ways to experience trust.

Looking back at these precious moments, though, I can't help but feel a certain
kind of loss for something that our complexity does not allow us to experience,
at least not past the early age in which we learn how to remember.

I wonder how it would feel if, in my own darker hours, when my own fears rise
to the surface and I can't find solace from my anxieties, I could turn to a
giant dog and cuddle into the fur of her belly, shivering lightly as the storm
washes over me. I wonder how it would be for her to gently lift me up into her 
crate, perhaps by the crook of my shirt if not by my neck, and snuggle around
me, helping me shed everything that I am and letting myself fade into the storm
that rages, safe between dirty paws and the solid warmth of a loving snout.

Can we even mourn for an experience that we can never have?
