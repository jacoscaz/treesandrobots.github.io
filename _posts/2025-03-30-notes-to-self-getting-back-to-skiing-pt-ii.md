Dear past me,

No matter how ridiculous it may sound, [your notes on skiing][1] really helped!
In fact, they made a pretty dramatic difference in both technique and, more 
importantly, endurance, allowing me to make the most out of the few ski trips
we did this year. 

Though I can't return the favour, I can at least pay it forward to future us;
I will point out, though, that we are doing all the work but he will be the one
reaping the benefits. The little shit! I hope someone will find a way to put an
icy snowball down the back of his jacket.

Anyway, back to your wonderful [notes][1], there's really only one that I feel
requires further elaboration:

> 6. You worry too much about forward / backward weight placement. Let your
>    body find the right balance given the conditions on the slope.

Actually... No. You are just plain wrong here. Though I will admit that we
tend to obsess about technique to a fault, future us is going to have much more
fun on his next skiing trip if he could spend a few minutes practicing using
the levers intrinsic to the geometry of the ski-boot system to make the
downhill ski _bite into the snow_ during turns. If done correctly, this will
compress the normally slightly-bent ski into a flatter shape, temporarily
storing energy that will be released upon exiting the turn as the springback
force, vectored into additional forward momentum.

When done correctly, doing the above should result in the absence of that
pesky and terribly inelegant sideways skidding of the downhill ski called 
_chattering_ that plagues the later hours of our skiing sessions. It should
also result in a small but perceivable acceleration when exiting the turn or,
at least, in the absence of a perceivable _deceleration_. Experientially, I
have found that keeping the downhill ski ever so slightly behind the uphill
one helps with maximizing leverage, resulting in less muscle fatigue required
to exercise the same amount of downward pressure.

For this to work, the fit of the boot is *critical*. The heel of our foot
should _never_ move upwards, no matter how much pressure we exert on the front
of the boot through the tibia, thus allowing ourselves to shift our center of
gravity a little forward of what we would otherwise settle into.

Obviously, even a perfect and consistent execution of the above &mdash; which
is called _carving_, by the way, and is the entire reason behind the side
cutouts of modern ski geometries &mdash; will get us nowhere near being able to
keep up with our wife, who will continue zooming past us in a manner that
appears to defy physics.

Oh well, at least we won't be too far behind.
