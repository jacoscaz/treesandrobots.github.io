_TL;DR - Not sure how to improve your running technique? Get a dog!_

After a long time of doing nothing and letting my work life compromise my body
in all sorts of annoying ways, I've recently teamed up with my brother to join
this year's [Inferno Water][inferno-run], a non-competitive 8km obstacle course
which feels like the perfect excuse to get back into a more reasonable shape.

Given that my current levels of fitness are akin to those of a block of stone, 
I have once again gone back to running regularly, much as I used to back in the
healthier days that preceded my decision of starting a company. These days, 
however, I am often delightfully accompanied by Nova, a loving rescue who has
consistently been making my life better ever since she joined our pack.

Partly due to her being a mix between a [Maremma Sheepdog][maremma-sheepdog]
and a hound breed of some sort, Nova's natural pace is usually steady and 
deliberate, punctuated by brief sessions of more stationary activities. As my
own natural pace is slightly faster than hers, running with her often becomes a
matter of slowing myself down just enough to let the both of us enjoy the
workout. <sup>[\[1\]](#foot-1)</sup>

To my surprise, trading my ideal pace for the wonderful companionship of my 
furry friend has also had a tremendous effect on my technique. Bound to a pace
that I can sustain with less effort and mental commitment, my attention seem to
naturally converge towards the act of running itself. When I run with Nova I am
generally much more aware of the state of my own body, from my posture to the 
way my feet are impacting the ground, and I am able to make small adjustments
almost effortlessly. Whereas arbitrarily limiting myself to a slower pace would
often leave me wondering about whether I could push things just a little bit
more, having to match Nova's own pace simply gets rid of the question entirely.

This has already resulted in a fairly dramatic change in my gait, going from a
pronounced heel-first gait to a much more controlled and efficient mid-sole 
strike directly underneath my body. In turn, these improvements have brought me
closer to what used to be my old average pace in a surprisingly short amount of
time and to greatly diminished stress on my knees.

Lesson learnt: sometimes, _slower_ is _better_ than _harder_ at getting us to 
_faster_ and _further_.

## Footnotes

\[<a id="foot-1">1</a>\]: Technically speaking, _running_ is a human gait that
does not translate to dogs very well. When we think of a running dog we usually
refer to a dog that is either [cantering or galloping][dog-gaits], two gaits
that in larger dogs such as Nova result in speeds that few humans are able to 
match (and certaily not me). When accompanying running humans, dogs usually 
resort to [trotting][dog-gaits], which is their most efficient gait.
