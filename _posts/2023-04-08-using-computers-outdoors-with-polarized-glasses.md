title: "Using computers outdoors with polarized glasses"
description: ""

I've recently had the unexpected experience of finding myself comfortably
coding outdoors in almost direct sunlight, wondering how in the world I could
see the screen so clearly in conditions that would have ordinarily made for a
headache-inducing and vision-destroying squinting session.

Turns out I had inadvertently kept on my new, [polarized][3] sunglasses
on and they were making _a world_ of difference.

The screen of my 13-inch, M1, 2020 MacBook Pro (model A2338) must produce light
of the same polarization that is let through by the polarizer in the sunglasses,
the unassuming `PLD 7031/S` from Polaroid. As natural light spreads across all
polarizations, the glasses block far more of it than they do of the screen's.

Effectively, the sunglasses dim the world around the screen more than they dim
the screen itself, partially compensating for the difference in brightness
and making for significantly more pleasant working conditions.

After concocting a ridicoulously over-engineered Lego&#8482; stand that allowed
me to use the glasses as filters for my phone's camera, I was able to clearly
verify and capture the effect:

Unfortunately these pictures do not make justice to the magnitude of the
difference made by the polarized lenses, likely due to the camera's inferior
dynamic range (compared to that of the human eye) and to the phone's internal
image processing.

Staring at computer screens outdoor in bright light for long stretches of time
may still damage your vision, polarized lenses or not. Do so at your own risk!
Furthermore, do not make the mistake of getting sunglasses with poor or absent 
UV protection as they _will_ cause more damage your vision than having no
glasses at all would. Aim for eyewear with [UV400 protection][2] or similar.

With that disclaimer out of the way, the combination of the MacBook's bright
screen and of my polarized sunglasses, together with an adequate amount of
shade, truly made for a couple of hours of very pleasant work with none of the
discomfort I had experienced in previous outdoor working sessions.
