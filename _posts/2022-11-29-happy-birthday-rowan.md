Dear Rowan,

Happy Birthday! I hope this message finds you well; full of laughter, and
mirth, and that wonderful twinkle in your eyes that shines through even the
most stubborn of internet connections.

We appear to have a lot in common, you know? I was born in November, too,
and I absolutely *love* playing with Lego(s). In fact, I'm closer in age to
your mom but I still play with Lego pretty much every week. All of my major
projects often start with a simple Lego model.

In fact, I think playing with Lego has taught me one of the greatest lessons
that I have ever learnt: the world is ours to enjoy, to discover, to understand
and to improve. Nothing is unknowable and everything can be learnt. From engines
to picture frames, there's little that cannot be crafted, fixed, repurposed or 
given a second life to. There is no scene that cannot be built, no character that
cannot be drawn, no line that cannot be written and no story that cannot be made
real.

The trick for doing all these is... Learn! Experiment! Always ask yourself
how something works, why it has been made that way, what is the story behind
it and who made it. With Lego you can create entire worlds made of wondrous
machines right in the comfort of your home, and let your fantasy inspire you as
to what you'll build next. Practice, and in time you'll see that the entire world
is, in a way, just a big set of Lego(s) to be figured out.

Never stop building, never stop making your ideas into reality, never stop telling
your stories.

Happy Birthday,
Jacopo.
