title: "An economic case for preserving attention"
description: Can an economic case be made for ceasing to hijack our focus?

I am always surprised by those who would rather discuss about _whether_
technology is shortening our attention span as opposed to _the degree_ to which
it is doing so. The reason behind my surprise is that I can clearly feel the 
impact that technology is having on my own attention span and on that of those
that are around me. I can feel myself becoming restless as I struggle to 
maintain focus on longer pieces of text, and I can feel the struggle growing as
time goes by. Moreover, and perhaps more significantly, I can feel how 
dramatically easier it becomes to maintain focus after a period of lower 
exposure to technology.

Although I am happy to see most scientific literature confirming that
technology _is_, indeed, shortening our attention span, my own internal
experience of this phenomenon is so incredibly clear that I just _know_ it
to be true, just as many others have pointed out time and time again before I
even started thinking about it. In a sense, we've been waiting for science to
catch up to this particular truth.

There has to be a point, however, after which the erosion of our collective
attention span begins to negatively affect that which has led to such
erosion in the first place: optimizing for user engagement and compulsory usage
patterns above all else to maximize exposure to advertisements.

How far are we from that point? Does that point even exist? Could an economic
case be made for ceasing to invest so many resources on hijacking our focus
before it starts to negatively affect ad-based business models?
