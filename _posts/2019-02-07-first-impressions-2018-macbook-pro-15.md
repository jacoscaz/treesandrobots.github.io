I've recently upgraded to a 2018 MacBook Pro 15'' from a 2013 MacBook Pro 13''. What follows is a list of first impressions after a few hours of normal use.

- The combined absence of USB-A, HDMI, Thunderbolt, a card-reader and a [MagSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) charging connector is annoying, frustrating and downright absurd.
- *Touch ID* is fantastic, particularly so when used with a password manager that supports fingerprint-based unlocking.
- The *Touch Bar*'s lack of physical keys and dynamic layout forces me to look away from the screen when I need keys such as `esc` and volume/brightness controls. Keys are there when I need them, they're just hard to locate by tactile navigation alone.
- The keyboard is worse than the 2013's but not quite as bad as I had expected. Whereas keys are bigger and closer to one another and key travel is exceedingly minimal, these are partially offset by a meaningful amount of tactile feedback. The overall typing experience is not drastically different from that of my 2013, although the balance of tactile vs. visual feedback required to confirm that a key has actually been pressed has definitely shifted towards its visual component. Also, my hands seem to tense up a little more while typing.
- The trackpad is a litte too big, particularly given its relative position to the keyboard. Although palm detection seems to be working nicely, my thumbs often cause the cursor to jump across the screen.
- I almost cannot believe the fact that the trackpad is a *Force Touch* trackpad, i.e. a trackpad with [haptic feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology). It feels *real*.
- The hinge is not a sturdy as the 2013's. This is most noticeable while on the move, such as during a train ride. The screen wobbles more than that of a 2013's 15'' and a lot more than my 2013's 13''. That said, screen wobble is still pretty good in absolute terms.
- The screen is amazing, crispier than the 2013's and with greater color accuracy. I wasn't expecting *True Tone* to make such a difference.
- The laptop is *fast* and seems free of thermal issues. I've yet to explore all the advantages brought by the new [T2 chip](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862) but its presence is immediately noticeable.

All in all, these first few hours with my new MacBook Pro made for a relatively solid experience, with the notable expection of requiring a separate and rather expensive USB-C hub right from the very beginning. 

When compared to my 2013, this machine feels like a significantly different compromise between thinness/aesthetics and functionality/reliability. Personally, I think Apple has gone a step too far towards the former while sacrificing too much of the latter. The feeling of sheer marvel and excitement that I experienced when I bought my 2013 has been replaced by a wary contentment that doesn't feel quite *enough* for a machine at this price point.
