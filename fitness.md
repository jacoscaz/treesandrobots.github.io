## Intro

I've been developing and [dogfooding][i1] my own fitness routine for a number
of years, mostly because I dislike commercial gyms and the mainstream approach
to fitness.

In 2024 I decided to adopt a more systematic approach to its development,
wanting to better track each change and the motivations behind it. I also had
a number of people ask about my workout regimen, which made versioning and
publishing within my blog somewhat of an obvious choice.

**_I am not a qualified professional and I share this program solely for
informative purposes._** Make sure to read the [license][i2] and [liability][i3]
sections below before continuing and always check in with your medical and
fitness professionals before making changes to your fitness regime.

## Goals

> [...] fitness is about performing well at any and every task imaginable.
>
> &mdash; [CrossFit Journal][g1]

1. **Day to day**: this routine is designed for people that, like me, have an
   easier time committing to smaller daily efforts rather than greater weekly
   ones.
2. **Generalist**: this routine is designed to develop general fitness levels.
   It does not optimize for strength, power, speed, endurance or hypertrophy
   but aims to strike a _functional_ compromise between each of these that can
   easily transfer to the trainee's daily life.
3. **Sustainable**: this routine is designed to minimize daily volume while
   maximizing weekly variety to lessen its impact on joints, ligaments and 
   allow for shorter recovery times.
4. **Portable**: this routine is designed to be relatively portable, minimizing
   the amount of required equipment and optimizing for equipment that easy to 
   carry around and craft.

## Equipment

While the routine is designed to be relatively portable, having access to some
or all of the following equipment definitely helps:

- A **set of gymnastic rings**, best when hanging from a tall branch. Two sets
  if you are using rings as alternatives for both the pull-up bar and the dip
  station.
- A **dip station**. Alternatively, chairs can suffice. Alternatively, rings
  can suffice.
- A **pull-up bar**. Prefer freestanding or wall-mounted/ceiling-mounted bars
  to doorway bars. Alternatively, a sturdy branch can suffice. Alternatively, 
  rings can suffice.
- A **dumbell weight set**.
- A **set of kettlebells**. Alternatively, kettlebell handles
  [for weight plates][e1] and/or [for dumbells][e2] can suffice.
- **sandbags** Best for squats, lifts and weighted exercises requiring heavier
  weights. Tip: use [pea gravel][e3] rather than sand.
- A **jump rope**. Good for warming up.
- A **rowing machine**. A very nice and versatile piece of equipment, ideal for
  warming up and slow days in which I do not feel like working out.
  
Note that many of these can be found in fitness parks all around the world.

## Changelog

### [2024-11-16](./fitness-routine/html/jaco-s-daily-fitness-routine-2024-11-16.html)

- Replaced thursday's horizontal pressing with push-up variations. Once greater
  stabilization requirements are brought in through specific variations I find
  push-up to be an overall superior, more complete exercise. See variations with
  either hands and/or feet on rings, raised legs, &hellip;
- Dropped handstand push-up from monday's vertical pressing due to the limited 
  ROM, particularly in the absence of handles, parallettes and so on.
- Greater structure to saturday's exercies with a focus on weights, given that
  the past week felt a little too biased towards control of the body and not of
  external objects.
