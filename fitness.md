## Intro

I've been developing and [dogfooding][i1] my own fitness routine for a number
of years, mostly because I dislike commercial gyms and the mainstream approach
to fitness.

In 2024 I decided to adopt a more systematic approach to its development,
wanting to better track each change and the motivations behind it. I also had
a number of people ask about my workout regimen, which made versioning and
publishing within my blog somewhat of an obvious choice.

**_I am not a qualified professional and I share this program solely for
informative purposes._** Make sure to read the [license][i2] and [liability][i3]
sections below before continuing and always check in with your medical and
fitness professionals before making changes to your fitness regime.

## The routine

The routine lives as a printer-friendly, evolving [HTML document][r4]. Previous
versions are linked in the [Changelog](#changelog) section below.

## Goals

> [...] fitness is about performing well at any and every task imaginable.
>
> &mdash; [CrossFit Journal][g1]

1. **Daily**: this routine is designed for people that, like me, have an
   easier time committing to smaller daily efforts rather than greater weekly
   ones.
2. **Generalist**: this routine is designed to develop general fitness levels.
   It does not optimize for strength, power, speed, endurance or hypertrophy
   but aims to strike a _functional_ compromise between each of these that can
   easily transfer to the trainee's daily life. As such, this routine focuses
   only on complex, multi-joint movements.
3. **Sustainable**: this routine is designed to minimize daily volume while
   maximizing weekly variety to lessen its impact on joints, ligaments and 
   allow for shorter recovery times.
4. **Portable**: this routine is designed to be relatively portable, minimizing
   the amount of required equipment and optimizing for equipment easy to carry
   around and/or [DIY][g3].
5. **Safe**: this routine is designed around weight types with greater
   stabilization requirements, limiting the amount of weight that the trainee
   will be able to move. This routine is also designed to minimize the risk of
   injury and/or damage inherent in handling heavy weights, selecting movement
   variations that can be easily aborted.
6. **Mindful**: this routine is designed around movement pairings that account
   for the neurological effort required to execute them while maintaining and
   developing body awareness and control. This is the primary reason behind the
   choice of having only one movement per session requiring external loads.

Whereas this routine mostly focuses on sandbags, some variations require
kettlebells. Needless to say, most things will break when impacted by a
a kettlebell unintentionally propelled into the air due to grip failure.
Be careful!

## Equipment

At minimum, this routine requires the following pieces of equipment:

- **Sandbags**. Specifically, [boulder-style][e4] sandbags, big and small.
  Instead of sand, consider filling with [pea gravel][e5]. Additionally and
  optionally, [log-style][e6] sandbags with handles.
- A **pull-up bar**. Prefer freestanding or wall-mounted/ceiling-mounted bars
  to doorway bars. Preferably high enough to strap rings on it. Alternatively,
  a sturdy branch can suffice. Alternatively, rings can suffice. 
- A **dip station** or any other kind of dipping setup. If nothing else is
  available, a set of high-back chairs can suffice. Alternatively, rings can
  suffice.
- A set of **dumbbells and plates** ([like these][e7]) accompanied by a couple
  of **kettlebell handles** ([like these][e8]).

### Rings 

A **set of gymnastic rings** can be an invaluable tool, both as a gateway to
(much) harder movements and variations but also as an incredibly portable,
all-in-one alternative to both the pull-up bar and the dip station. Get good
straps with good buckles! You do not want to fall head-first into the ground
while inverted.

<aside markdown="1">
**Beware of using rings too soon!**.  Particularly when it comes to pushing
exercises (push-up, dip), rings can lead you to inadvertent poor shoulder
placement and scapular movement, greatly increasing the risk of injury.
**Being able to support yourself on rings is not an indicator that you have
the strength to perform dynamic movements on them.**
</aside>  

### Additional equipment

Other pieces of equipment I highly suggest:

- A **rowing machine**. A very nice and versatile piece of equipment, ideal for
  warming up and slow days in which I do not feel like working out.
- A **jump rope**. Good for warming up and HIIT/metcon workouts.

## Changelog

### [2025-01-10](./fitness-routine/html/jaco-s-daily-fitness-routine-2025-01-10.html)

- Kept same exercise pairings but swapped days around for a more consistent
  alternation of push and pull, mostly to prevent overstressing ligaments and
  tendons around the elbows

### [2024-11-30](./fitness-routine/html/jaco-s-daily-fitness-routine-2024-11-30.html)

- Slightly reduced daily load while increasing specificity by making each day
  focus on only two movements rather than three, with more sets per exercise. 
- Further reduced equipment requirements by focusing exclusively on sandbags
  and kettlebells.
- Dropped kettlebell swings and clean & press from strength routine, the former
  because it's exceedingly dynamic for high loads and the latter because it
  works better as a benchmark movement than a day-to-day one, given I can clean
  significantly more than I can press.

### [2024-11-16](./fitness-routine/html/jaco-s-daily-fitness-routine-2024-11-16.html)

- Replaced thursday's horizontal pressing with push-up variations. Once greater
  stabilization requirements are brought in through specific variations I find
  push-up to be an overall superior, more complete exercise. See variations with
  either hands and/or feet on rings, raised legs, &hellip;
- Dropped handstand push-up from monday's vertical pressing due to the limited 
  ROM, particularly in the absence of handles, parallettes and so on.
- Greater structure to saturday's exercies with a focus on weights, given that
  the past week felt a little too biased towards control of the body and not of
  external objects.
