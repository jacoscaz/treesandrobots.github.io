We are each defined, in part, by lists. Some of these lists are fully known 
to us and we can clearly recall each of their individual entries. Others are
almost entirely unknown to us, often to great susprise or annoyance. Others
still we may not even be aware of.

In many ways, growing up is about discovering, maintaining, expanding and
letting go of the lists through which we define ourselves in the eyes of others
and of our own.

These are some of my lists:

- [Things](/lists/things.html)
- [Software dependencies](/lists/software-dependencies.html)
