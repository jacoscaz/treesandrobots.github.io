I like to surround myself with _good_ things. Not necessarily the _best_,
not necessarily the _most beautiful_, not necessarily the _most practical_.
Just... _good_. A balanced compromise between aesthetics, functionality, 
practicality, durability, cost and environmental impact. 

What follows is an ongoing effort to list and keep track of some of these
things. Ideally, I'd like to expand this list until it encompasses everything
that adds significant, tangible value to my life.

not finding it or, worse, finding something sub-par that slows me down or ruins
my work.
