<p class="lead"><a href="{{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url }}">Trees and 
Robots</a> is a blog about programming and life in general,  written by 
<a href="https://jacoscaz.com">Jacopo Scazzosi</a>.</p>

The website is of [the static variety][3], generated by [Jekyll][1] and hosted 
on [GitHub Pages][2]. It is self-contained, including all images, and
does not use cookies nor JavaScript nor any other external resource.

Trees and Robots does not track its visitors and does not store personal 
information. The only third-party service used is [GoatCounter][4], a wonderful
web statistics platform that is fully open-source, privacy-aware and committed
to tracking *vists*, not *visitors*.
