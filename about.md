<p class="lead">
Hi, I'm Jacopo. Welcome to Trees and Robots, my personal blog.
</p>

I'm a self-employed software developer focusing on platforms for the Internet
of Things, smart buildings, electric mobility, the energy and climate sectors.
I help my clients bring their ideas to life, sometimes as a consultant and 
sometimes as a contractor. I've been called senior backend developer, technical
lead and software architect. 

In the past I've co-founded and run a small software consultancy, expanding my
skillset with elements of accounting, forecasting and project management. As of
2023 I'm enjoying the lower mental overheads of self-employment, a path that
I plan to continue walking for a few years. Eventually, I'd like to run a small
company once more, this time focused on a product or service.

On the internet I mostly go by as **jacoscaz**. You can reach me on [GitHub][4]
or via [e-mail][5].
